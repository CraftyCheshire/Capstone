        <h1>How I got into Modeling</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="indent">I always wanted to be on camera. I've always been quite theatrical and eccentric with my behaviors. From an early age, I used to act in the grocery stores because I was sure that if the security cameras saw me, I would get noticed and become famous.</p>
        <p class="indent">One year at Mardi Gras, I was in Covington, Louisiana, celebrating with friends. Through my friends, I was introduced to a photographer who was looking for a "different" model. He wanted someone who would do things that were uncommonly asked for. I am a very shameless and adventurous person, so I agreed to work with him one day.</p>
        <p class="indent">The time came for us to work together and I was immediately comfortable with him and his partner. They were kind, funny, and totally relaxed. They put me to ease in no time. While they were setting the cameras up, we joked and laughed about things as if we'd always been friends.</p>
        <p class="indent">Once we started getting down to business, I turned my serious cap on and got to work. I used all of the gathered knowledge I had attained through years of observation. I posed and in that moment it was only me and the camera. I felt like I could see the results in my head. I was working my magic! I got compliments from them and they repeatedly asked if this was for sure my first time modeling. We had a blast.</p>
        <p class="indent">As for "different," I gave them whatever they asked for and more. I climbed the hallway walls, stood in the windowsill, and jumped off the stairs. I sat on a toilet with a cigarette and a bottle of Jack Daniels while wearing a "MAGA" hat. I even flashed the camera in broad daylight, for everyone to see. When I was in front of that camera, I was fearless.</p>
